# libraryInfo
<p>A basic program to demonstrate how component and composite classes work as part of study.</p>
<p>The Author class is the component class, and the Book class is the composite class. The relationship between the two classes is that a Book has a(n) Author.</p>
<p>It is planned to expand this program to be usable as a data point for librarians.</p>
